# ECG Anomaly Detection and Classification

The aim of this project is to perform anomaly detection and classification in time series, in particular on health data related to ECG signals, which are recordings of the heart's electrical activity. To perform these tasks, we will use an available dataset which contains ECG data of real patients: ECG5000. After analyzing the data we will use deep learning techniques for anomaly detection, which include an Autoencoder and a LSTM Autoencoder, both implemented using Keras library and trained in order to perform signal reconstruction and be able to distinguish a normal signal from an anomaly, which happens when some kind of arrhythmia is present. As for the classification task, different deep learning models were trained: CNN, LSTM and their combination using Keras library.
